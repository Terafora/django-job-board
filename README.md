# django-job-board

## Brief

This job-board site was a little exercise in getting used to the Django language.
So far I'm really happy with how this turned out and all the new features I'm learning for this framework.

## Future Plans

Further down the road I plan on making this a more feature rich application which can have employers and job seekers sign up to post and apply for work respectively, among other things.
